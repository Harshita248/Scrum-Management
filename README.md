 ## Overview 🎃

It is basically a Kanban Board app which provides teams with the option of managing pull-based, lean software development projects with other iterative and time-boxed projects. 
The Kanban Board allows the user to trigger an update to the Schedule State field for any drag-and-drop action from one column to another column. 
Using the Schedule State field enables a view of work regardless of the methodology that each team practices because many pages such as Release Status show status and roll-ups based on the Schedule State field.
Product backlog, time-boxed iterations, and estimation are unnecessary when using a Kanban system since work is pulled into the board and the queue is the only work of interest. 
Achieving maximum throughout is the main goal by determining bottlenecks in the system and limiting the work in progress to reduce task context switching and ensure work is completed efficiently and quickly.
In other words, a Kanban board only shows the next few stories that need to be completed and it's current state of progress. 
The stories are determined by your project's backlog and the state of any story is changed as you drag the story across any state.

cd (filename)
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b dev_username
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes 🚏

Do the necessary changes.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "(Add your message here)"

replacing `<Add your message here>` with your message.

## Push changes to GitHub 🪂

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

replacing `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review 🚩

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

Soon we will be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
