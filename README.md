 ## Overview 🎃

It is basically a Kanban Board app which provides teams with the option of managing pull-based, lean software development projects with other iterative and time-boxed projects. 
The Kanban Board allows the user to trigger an update to the Schedule State field for any drag-and-drop action from one column to another column. 
Using the Schedule State field enables a view of work regardless of the methodology that each team practices because many pages such as Release Status show status and roll-ups based on the Schedule State field.
Product backlog, time-boxed iterations, and estimation are unnecessary when using a Kanban system since work is pulled into the board and the queue is the only work of interest. 
Achieving maximum throughout is the main goal by determining bottlenecks in the system and limiting the work in progress to reduce task context switching and ensure work is completed efficiently and quickly.
In other words, a Kanban board only shows the next few stories that need to be completed and it's current state of progress. 
The stories are determined by your project's backlog and the state of any story is changed as you drag the story across any state.
